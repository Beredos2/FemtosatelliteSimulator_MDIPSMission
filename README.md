# FemtosatelliteSimulator_MDIPSMission
This is a repository for the code that will be used to simulate a swarm-type femtosatellite mission. 
It is used as a proof of concept in-simulation that demonstrates how massively distributed swarms 
produce data sets that can be analyised both in time and space indepenently. A Gaussian Process Regression
is carried out on the data to demonstrate the predictive power enabled by this type of mission.
